## Introduction

Roleplaying Coder (RPC) will be a roleplaying game designed to teach children at the middle school level programming concepts while simultaneously giving a storyline and unique and entertaining gaming experience. 

## Audience
Many children in grades five through eight are not exposed to computer science topics, despite the prevalence of computer science jobs in today’s society. The popularity of gaming in all age groups is continuously rising. This makes using games to teach middle schoolers coding concepts a very good platform. There are already some smaller scale games available to teach different age groups, but there are none designed to be targeted to middle schoolers who enjoy playing role playing games and also want to learn about programming. 

## Goal
The goal of RPC is to introduce children of ages ten to fourteen to programming concepts. The game will focus on a male or female character (player’s choice) who goes on a quest. During the combat stages and the gear creation phases of the game the player will have to use creative, logical, and problem solving skills in order to advance in the game.
